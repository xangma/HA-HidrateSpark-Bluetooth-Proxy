A native Home Assistant integration for HidrateSpark smart water bottles.
Connects via Bluetooth — local adapter **or an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy** — and
exposes the bottle as a Home Assistant device. No MQTT broker, no Docker
container, no Linux box near the bottle.

This fork also includes a standalone Android companion that connects directly
to the bottle and synchronizes individual drinks to Health Connect. It does not
need Home Assistant or the Hidrate cloud.

This is a port of [HidrateSpark-MQTT-bridge][bridge] re-architected onto Home
Assistant's own Bluetooth stack.

[bridge]: https://github.com/loryanstrant/HidrateSpark-MQTT-bridge

## Why this exists

The MQTT bridge needs a Linux host with a working Bluetooth adapter near the
bottle. That's fine for a Raspberry Pi on the kitchen counter, less fine if
your Home Assistant install is in a closet on the other side of the house.

This integration uses HA's `bluetooth` integration for transport, which means
**any ESPHome Bluetooth proxy** in range of the bottle is enough — the proxy
relays GATT operations back to HA, and this integration runs the same
HydroSync handshake and frame parser end-to-end. The same code path also
works with a directly-attached USB or onboard adapter.

## Features

- 🔋 Battery percentage
- 💧 Per-sip events with timestamps and dedup (within ±2 s / same volume)
- 📊 Daily total (rolls at local midnight) and lifetime total
- 🚰 Auto-refill detection (cap-open/close + weight delta ≥ 25 mL)
- ⚖️ Live fill level from the on-bottle weight sensor (auto-calibrated)
- 🛟 Sip-exceeds-fill fallback when no weight anchor exists yet
- 🔁 State persists across HA restarts via the Store API
- 📥 Buffered sips replay on reconnect with their original timestamps
- ❤️ Direct, retry-safe Bluetooth → Health Connect sync through the Android companion

**NOTE:** This has only been tested on a HidrateSpark PRO (v1) 21oz / 621ml with chug lid.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.4 or later
- The `bluetooth` integration set up (it's the default on HAOS)
- Either a local Bluetooth adapter on the HA host **or** an ESPHome
  Bluetooth proxy within range of the bottle
- The bottle paired once with the official HidrateSpark phone app — this puts
  it into "remembered" mode and registers its MAC

## Install

### HACS (recommended)

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/xangma/HA-HidrateSpark-Bluetooth-Proxy` as an
   **Integration**
3. Install **HidrateSpark Bluetooth Proxy**, restart HA
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → HidrateSpark**

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/hidratespark_bluetooth_proxy/` into your HA
`config/custom_components/` folder, restart HA, then add the integration from
**Devices & Services**.

## Setup

If your bottle is already advertising in range of HA (or a proxy), it appears
as a Bluetooth discovery and you only need to confirm the capacity. Otherwise
**+ Add Integration → HidrateSpark** lets you pick the bottle from a list of
discovered devices, or type its MAC address directly.

You can change the bottle's capacity later via the integration's **Configure**
button.

## Standalone Health Connect sync

The Android companion connects to the bottle itself; installing Home Assistant
is not required:

1. Build and install the Android companion:

   ```shell
   cd android-companion
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

2. Fully close the official Hidrate app and disable any Home Assistant
   connection to the bottle.
3. Open **HidrateSpark Health Sync**, scan for the bottle, confirm its capacity,
   then tap **Save, grant access, and sync**.

The companion needs Android 9 or newer. Health Connect is built into Android
14+; Android 9–13 users must install Google's Health Connect app.

The phone performs the same HydroSync handshake as the Home Assistant
integration. It commits every sip to a local SQLite journal before
acknowledging the bottle, writes one idempotent `HydrationRecord` per sip, and
marks the local row complete only after Health Connect accepts it. WorkManager
reconnects to the saved bottle address periodically.

The companion requests write-only hydration and Bluetooth access, reads no
health data, has no Internet permission or analytics, and sends nothing to a
server. See [the companion documentation](android-companion/README.md) for
build details and limitations.

## Coexisting Bluetooth clients

The bottle accepts only one BLE central at a time. The official app, Home
Assistant integration, and standalone Health Connect companion therefore
cannot sync simultaneously. Recommended setups:

- **Direct Health Connect:** close the official app and disable the HA
  integration for this bottle
- **Home Assistant:** do not schedule the direct companion against the same
  bottle
- **Occasional firmware updates:** open the phone app briefly, then close it

## Entities

| Entity | Type |
|---|---|
| Battery | sensor (%, `battery`) |
| Water today | sensor (mL, `total_increasing`) |
| Water lifetime | sensor (mL, `total_increasing`) |
| Current fill | sensor (mL) |
| Current fill percent | sensor (%) |
| Last sip volume | sensor (mL) |
| Last sip time | sensor (timestamp) |
| Bottle weight (raw) | diagnostic, disabled by default |
| Connected | binary_sensor (connectivity) |

## What survives a disconnect

| Data | Buffered on bottle? | Recovered on reconnect? |
|---|---|---|
| Sips (volume + timestamp) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Replayed with original timestamps |
| Daily / lifetime totals | derived | ✅ Recomputed from replayed sips |
| Battery | ✅ | ✅ Re-read on connect |
| Current fill | ✅ | ✅ Snaps to true value within ~2 s |
| Cap open/close events | ❌ notify-only | ❌ Lost while away |
| Refill events while away | ❌ notify-only | ❌ Resulting fill level recovered, the event itself is not |
