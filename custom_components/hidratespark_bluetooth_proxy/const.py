# Weight encoding.
# The weight characteristic streams a 16-bit big-endian value (high<<8 | low).
# Earlier firmwares were assumed to put an orientation flag in the high byte and
# the weight in the low byte, but on legacy-firmware bottles (e.g. 32oz) the high
# byte rises *with* the weight (observed 0x8Exx at ~75% full, 0x90xx when full),
# so the whole u16 is the reading. We therefore treat the full u16 as the weight
# and detect a trustworthy "upright & settled" reading by stability: N consecutive
# samples within RAW_STABLE_TOLERANCE. Transient frames while the bottle is moved
# never form a streak, so they are filtered without needing a magic byte.

# u16 = 35880, so 1235 raw units span 946 mL = ~1.305 raw/mL. This is a load-cell
# property, so it should hold across bottle sizes on the same puck.
