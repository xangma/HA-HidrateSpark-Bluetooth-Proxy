# HidrateSpark for Home Assistant

A native Home Assistant integration for HidrateSpark smart water bottles.

Connects via Bluetooth — local adapter **or ESPHome Bluetooth proxy** — and
exposes the bottle as a Home Assistant device with sips, totals, current fill,
battery, and refill detection. No MQTT broker, no cloud, no Docker container.
An optional standalone Android companion connects directly to the bottle and
synchronizes individual drinks to Health Connect through a durable local
journal. Home Assistant is not required for that path.

This is a port of [HidrateSpark-MQTT-bridge][bridge] re-architected to use HA's
own Bluetooth stack.
